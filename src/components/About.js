      <h2>Learn more about me.</h2>
      <p>
        Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, I studied Illustration at
        Chisholm Institute and then Multimedia at Swinburne University. I have
        always been a creative individual with a knack for problem solving and I
        have a passion for art and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I have also developed a love of coding, which I taught
        myself through online courses on the Pluralsight and Coursera platforms.
        I recently moved with my partner to Toronto, Canada and took the
        opportunity to pursue this passion further as a software developer.
      </p>
      <p>I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.</p>
